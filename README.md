# 🧭 Exploring AI Frontiers in Manufacturing | Intel Course Log 📈

**Explorer:** Jashpalsinh Rana

This repository serves as my expedition log, chronicling the journey through Intel's AI for Manufacturing course. Here, I document the discoveries and applications of Artificial Intelligence within the manufacturing landscape.

## 🗺️ Territories Charted (Weekly Assignments)

Each week, we venture into new territory, mapping out AI's potential:

**Week 1: Introduction to AI for Manufacturing** - [Topic: Introduction to AI for manufacturing and use cases of AI in manufacturing] -> ([Ai-for-manufacturing-course-assignments/Week 1 Assignment/](https://github.com/JashpalsinhRana99/Ai-for-manufacturing-course-assignments/tree/main/Week%201%20Assignment))

**Week 2: Introduction to AI Programming** - [Topic: Basic Python language and basics of Python libraries] -> ([Ai-for-manufacturing-course-assignments/Week 2 Assignment/](https://github.com/JashpalsinhRana99/Ai-for-manufacturing-course-assignments/tree/main/Week%202%20Assignment))

**Week 3: AI Project Cycle for Manufacturing** - [Topic: Problem scoping, Data Acquisition, Data Exploration, Modelling, Evaluation, and Deployment] -> ([Ai-for-manufacturing-course-assignments/Week 3 Assignment/](https://github.com/JashpalsinhRana99/Ai-for-manufacturing-course-assignments/tree/main/Week%203%20Assignment))

**Week 4: Handling Data** - [Topic: Introduction, Data collection, Data Storage, Data Preprocessing, Data analysis and Visualization, and Ethics in Data handling] -> ([Ai-for-manufacturing-course-assignments/Week 4 Assignment/](https://github.com/JashpalsinhRana99/Ai-for-manufacturing-course-assignments/tree/main/Week%204%20Assignment))

Each linked directory contains the field notes (code, notebooks) and findings (reports, analysis) from that week's exploration.

## 🎒 Gear & Techniques

Our toolkit for this expedition includes [Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc.] applied to solve manufacturing-specific problems.
